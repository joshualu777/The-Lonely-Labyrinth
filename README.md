Welcome to The Lonely Labyrinth, a maze-puzzle game where the player must explore a dark maze and find the door that leads to the exit.

Instructions:
1. Use WASD to move. Press 'Z' to get a zoomed out view of the maze. Press the 'SPACE' bar to place down a light/marker that can be seen from anywhere when using the zoomed out view, and press 'X' to pick up a light. Only a total of 25 lights can be placed at the same time.
2. The goal will be to finish the maze in as little time as possible. The timer will be located at the top right-hand corner. A number at the bottom right-hand corner shows the current distance between the player and the destination.
3. After the goal is reached, the screen will display how much time the player took, the total number of lights placed, and the greatest number of active lights the player had at any given time. There is also a statistics screen, which shows which direction the player took at each given junction in the maze.
4. Currently, there are 3 levels. The mazes in levels 1 and 2 follow a tree structure. This means that the several paths (or branches) in the maze will not merge or intersect. However, the maze in level 3 does not follow that structure, and the "current distance" number on the bottom right-hand corner is disabled.

Have fun playing!

FYI: This game was initially made to be used as a desktop application, and the QUIT button would allow the user to exit the application. However, this would not work on a web browser, and clicking the QUIT button will just cause the screen to freeze, as there is no application to exit. If that happens, refresh the page, and everything will go back to normal.

The design, programming, and art of this game were created by Joshua Lu using Unity and Adobe Photoshop. Free audio assets from the Unity Asset Store were used for the UI sound effects, the UI music, the in-game sound effects, and the in-game music. The pixel font used throughout the game also came for free from the Unity Asset Store.
